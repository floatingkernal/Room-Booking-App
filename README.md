## API Documentation
https://github.com/UTSCC09/project-json/blob/Documentation/Sal/doc/README.md

## Description:
A web application that provides rooms for rental. This is for people who are intersted in renting out a room or space for a social, business, or even personal purpose. Users can view nearby rooms that are available to rent. Once they find a room, they will be contacted by the room owner and can coordinate payment and scheduling. When they are finished using the room, they can leave a rating/review of their stay. The admins/host of the room can see the stats of every room and make pricing decision based on that. Admins/hosts are able to create rooms and add images along with a description to attract people to their listing
